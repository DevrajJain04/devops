Here's a revised 15 day Java backend development plan, focusing on backend technologies and skipping basic programming:

Day 1 3: OOP, Streams API, and Advanced Java    
Topics:    
OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)  
Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and #Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory)  
Streams API – Filter, Map, Reduce, Collectors  
#Functional Programming (Lambdas, Method References)  
Goal:   Solid understanding of OOP and functional programming to write clean, modular code.


Day 4 6: Spring Boot & REST API Development    
Topics:    
Spring Boot Setup (Maven/Gradle)  
Creating REST APIs – Controllers, Request/Response Handling  
Dependency Injection (DI) and #Inversion of Control (IoC)  
Postman API Testing  
Hands on:    
Build a basic "Task Manager" API with endpoints for CRUD operations.  
Goal:   Build and expose REST APIs using Spring Boot.



Day 7 8: Data Access (JPA, Hibernate, and SQL)    
Topics:    
JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate ORM  
Connecting to Databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL)  
CRUD Operations with Repositories  
Relationships (One to Many, Many to Many)  
Hands on:    
Build entity models for "Users" and "Tasks" and create database tables.  
Goal:   Seamless database interaction using Spring Data JPA.



Day 9: Microservices Architecture    
Topics:    
Introduction to Microservices  
Breaking Monolith into Microservices  
Building Multiple Independent Microservices with Spring Boot  
Service Discovery (Eureka)  
Hands on:    
Create 2 microservices – User Service and Task Service.  
Goal:   Basic microservice architecture implementation.



Day 10: API Gateway and Communication    
Topics:    
API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)  
Inter Service Communication (RestTemplate, WebClient)  
Feign Clients for Easier Microservices Calls  
Hands on:    
Implement an API Gateway for routing between microservices.  
Goal:   Manage inter microservice calls efficiently.


Day 11: Message Queues & Event Driven Architecture    
Topics:    
Kafka/RabbitMQ Basics  
Publishing and Consuming Messages  
Event Driven Microservices  
Hands on:    
Create a simple notification service triggered by user actions.  
Goal:   Learn asynchronous processing and decoupling services.



Day 12: Caching and Performance Optimization    
Topics:    
Redis Integration for Caching  
In Memory Caching with Spring Cache  
API Rate Limiting and Throttling  
Hands on:    
Cache frequently queried endpoints for faster performance.  
Goal:   Optimize API response times and reduce database load.



Day 13: Security and Authentication    
Topics:    
Spring Security Basics  
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Stateless Authentication  
OAuth2 Integration (Optional)  
Hands on:    
Secure Task Manager APIs with JWT.  
Goal:   Protect APIs and manage user sessions securely.



Day 14: Docker, CI/CD, and Deployment    
Topics:    
Containerizing with Docker  
Jenkins/GitHub Actions for CI/CD  
Deploying on AWS/Heroku  
Hands on:    
Dockerize and deploy the Task Manager app.  
Goal:   Automate deployments and make services production ready.



Day 15: Final Project (Full Stack)    
Topics:    
Combine all concepts – REST API, Microservices, Security, and Deployment.  
Create a Full Stack App (Backend Focused)  
Example: Notes App with Authentication, CRUD, and Notifications.  
Goal:   Apply all concepts in a real world project.
